/**
 * Moneybird MCP Tools Wrapper
 * 
 * This module provides direct access to Moneybird MCP tools.
 * MCP tools are available as functions in the Cursor environment.
 */

/**
 * Call Moneybird MCP tool
 * This is a helper that will be used to call MCP tools
 * In the actual implementation, these will be direct MCP tool calls
 */

// Note: MCP tools are available in the Cursor environment
// We'll implement these as async functions that call the MCP tools

/**
 * This file is kept for future use if we need a dynamic MCP tool caller.
 * Currently, MCP tools are called directly in mcpClient.ts
